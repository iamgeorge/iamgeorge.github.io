					<h3><i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb custom-icon"></i>8.2 Evaluation Focus & Questions</h3>
					<p><strong>1. Focus: What is most important to evaluate and why?</strong><br>We chose to focus on the effectiveness of the cooking app's learning components (videos, AI feedback, personalization, and community features) in supporting learners' cooking skills, meal planning, and confidence. These are the core instructional features of the program, and evaluating their impact helps us determine whether the app is achieving its primary learning objectives. It also provides insight into how different design elements contribute to learner outcomes, which is essential for iterative improvement.</p>
					<p><strong>2. Evaluation Questions</strong></p>
					<table>
						<thead>
							<tr>
								<th>Who might use the evaluation?</th>
								<th>What do they want to know?</th>
								<th>How will they use results?</th>
							</tr>
						</thead>
						<tbody>
							<tr><td>Product designers</td><td>Which features improve user learning and engagement?</td><td>To improve app features and usability</td></tr>
							<tr><td>Curriculum developers</td><td>Are learners achieving the intended cooking and planning skills?</td><td>To refine the learning modules</td></tr>
							<tr><td>Investors/stakeholders</td><td>Is the product demonstrating behavior change and long-term impact?</td><td>To decide on future funding or scale-up</td></tr>
							<tr><td>Users</td><td>Is the app helping them build cooking confidence and save time/money?</td><td>To decide whether to continue using the app</td></tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>
					<p><strong>What categories of evaluation questions are being addressed?</strong><br><span class="tag">Process</span> Frequency of chatbot use, types of meals cooked.<br><span class="tag">Outcome</span> Mastery of cooking skills, meal planning success.<br><span class="tag">Impact</span> Changes in confidence, dietary behavior, and motivation.</p>
					<p><strong>What is the balance of Formative to Summative Evaluation questions and why?</strong><br>We included a mix of formative (e.g., module-end reviews, monthly chatbot feedback) and summative (e.g., end-of-program surveys, 3-month follow-up) questions. This balance allows us to make real-time improvements while also evaluating overall effectiveness after learners complete the program.</p>

					<p><strong>Overall adequacy:</strong><br>Taken together, the indicators provide a well-rounded view of whether users are gaining foundational cooking skills. They combine both performance data and self-perception, which helps triangulate results. While reliance on self-report is a limitation, this is balanced by objective in-app assessments and user behavior logs.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="box">
					<h3><i class="fa-solid fa-clock custom-icon"></i>Timing</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>End-of-module check-ins help monitor learning incrementally.</li>
						<li>Monthly and mid-program checkpoints identify areas for early improvement.</li>
						<li>End-of-program and follow-up assessments capture retention and behavior change.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<div class="box">
					<h3><i class="fa-solid fa-balance-scale custom-icon"></i>Strengths, Weaknesses & Concerns</h3>
					<p>Overall, we think the evaluation plan does a good job covering the most important areas—like whether users are actually learning to cook, feeling more confident, planning meals better, and getting support when they need it. The indicators we chose are closely tied to what the app is trying to teach, which makes the data more meaningful. That said, we are relying a lot on self-reported data, which could be biased or not fully accurate. Some of the behavior-based indicators, like changes in grocery shopping habits, might also be tricky to measure clearly. We're also a bit concerned about whether users will actually respond to follow-up surveys, and whether we can keep the data collection tools consistent across different parts of the app.</p>
