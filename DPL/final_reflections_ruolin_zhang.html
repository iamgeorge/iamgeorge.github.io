      <div>
        The biggest challenge I faced was balancing creative ambition with realistic execution, especially under tight academic and design timelines. I had a clear vision of what an engaging, behavior-changing cooking experience should look like—one that integrates personalization, time-saving guidance, and reflective learning. However, structuring those ideas into a coherent and effective learning flow required ongoing revision and thoughtful decision-making.<br><br>
        I overcame this challenge by working iteratively, aligning every design step with our learning goals, and focusing on what would truly benefit our target users: busy college students with limited time and resources.

      <div class="q"><i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i>Something you found especially interesting or rewarding</div>
      <div>
        One of the most rewarding parts of this project was seeing how abstract ideas—like improving self-confidence and planning ability through cooking—could be translated into concrete learner activities. Designing the "Plan a Week of Meals" simulation was particularly fulfilling. It became a moment where learning met real-life application, giving students a space to reflect, make informed decisions, and take ownership of their health and habits.

      <div class="q"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-question"></i>Something you found particularly difficult</div>
      <div>
        A major difficulty was designing assessment components that went beyond right-or-wrong answers. I wanted to find ways to assess not just whether students remembered something, but whether they could apply it meaningfully in their own lives. Coming up with formative and summative evaluation methods—like self-assessment prompts or confidence tracking—that were both feasible and pedagogically sound took more time and creativity than I initially anticipated.
