                      <summary><h3 style="display: inline;"> 📱 Idea #1: Guided & Gamified Mobile Cooking Companion</h3></summary>
                      <p>a mobile application designed to guide busy college students through the process of planning and cooking healthy, time-efficient meals using basic kitchen tools.</p>

                      <h4><strong>Main Features:</strong></h4>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Short video tutorials (similar to YouTube and social media content that students already use) demonstrating recipes and cooking techniques.</li>
                        <li>Interactive meal planning tools that allow students to input dietary needs, budget, and time constraints to generate recipe suggestions.</li>
                      </ul>
                  
                      <h4><strong>Rationale:</strong></h4>
                      <p>Faced by college students, offering quick and accessible cooking solutions via a familiar platform (mobile apps). The use of short video tutorials aligns with how students currently learn to cook (YouTube, social media), making the learning experience more engaging and less intimidating than traditional guides. Gamification can help to motivate students to cook regularly and develop healthy habits.

                      <h4><strong>Pros:</strong></h4>
                      <ul>
                        <li>✔ Customizable experience: having a tool where students are able to input their dietary restrictions and preferences helps in personalizing the experience for each learner.</li>
                        <li>✔ Engaging and accessible: the short video tutorials are easily accessible on a mobile device and the use of short videos keeps the learners engaged in the learning activity.</li>
                        <li>✔ User Control: short video tutorials allows the learner to control their experience by pausing or rewinding the video whenever they need to.</li>
                      </ul>
                  
                      <h4><strong>Cons:</strong></h4>
                      <ul>
                        <li>✖ Lack of interactivity: Because the learners only follow the video tutorials, there is no way for the learners to ask questions or get immediate feedback from the instructor or chef.</li>
                      </ul>

                    <p>This idea involves combining a skillshare type of video learning program with courses and recipes created by real chefs/experts, with an AI chatbot to support and customize the learning experience for the learners, teaching learners how to meal prep and cook recipes that are time efficient and personalized to their lifestyle and preferences.</p>
              
                    <h4><strong>Main Features:</strong></h4>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Several meal prepping and cooking video modules that the learners can choose from.</li>
                      <li>Real chefs, available at designated times for feedback, or responses to submitted questions.</li>
                      <li>An additional AI chatbot that can help assist them with immediate feedback, support or troubleshooting, and personalizing their experience.</li>
                    </ul>
              
                    <h4><strong>Rationale:</strong></h4>
                    <p>From our analysis phase, we found that the problem wasn’t the learner’s ability to cook but their motivation and knowledge on cooking and meal prepping with significant time constraints from their busy college schedules. Because of this, I think creating a learning platform that still allows them to learn the basics of cooking and meal prepping while allowing them to also customize the experience to their personal lifestyle and preferences could help in improving their cooking skills and start being more mindful about the food that they eat, all while balancing their busy lifestyle.</p>
              
                    <h4><strong>Pros:</strong></h4>
                    <ul>
                     <li> ✔ Immediate assistance and customization: The use of an AI chatbot to assist the learner while the cook and offer customization options according to their preferences creates a more personalized experience for the learner.</li>
                     <li> ✔ Interactive and Engaging: Being able to receive feedback from real chefs and getting assistance from the AI chatbot creates a more engaging learning experience that motivates the learner to continue learning.</li>
                    </ul>
              
                    <h4><strong>Cons:</strong></h4>
                    <ul>
                     <li> ✖ Chefs limited availability: If students want to have a one-on-one feedback session with the chefs, their schedules might not align with each other.</li>
                    <li>  ✖ AI Limitations: There is always a risk that the information given by AI isn’t 100% accurate which can cause problems or delays in the learning activity.</li>

                    <summary><h3 style="display: inline;"> 🎮 Idea #3: AR Cooking Game</h3></summary>
                    <p>It is an augmented reality cooking game designed , inspired by the popular cooperative game Overcooked. The game offers interactive, kitchen-based challenges that become progressively more complex, structured into clear levels of difficulty (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced). Students engage individually and prepare virtual dishes in their own kitchens with limited time, guided by real-time AR visuals and instructions.</p>
              
                    <h4><strong>Main Features:</strong></h4>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Augmented Reality (AR): Overlays animated cooking tasks, recipe steps, timers, and tips directly onto the student’s real cooking environment.</li>
                      <li>Gamified Interface: Levels, leaderboards, badges, and scoring systems to enhance motivation and competitive spirit.</li>
                      <li>Interactive Tutorials: Step-by-step animated guidance for each cooking skill required at every level of difficulty.</li>
                      <li>Timed Cooking Challenges: Encourages students to cook efficiently under pressure, mirroring real-life cooking scenarios.</li>
                    </ul>
              
                    <h4><strong>Rationale:</strong></h4>
                    <p>Engaging and Immersive: The game-like AR environment significantly boosts learner engagement and motivation through a visually interactive and enjoyable cooking experience.<br />
                    Progressive Skill Development: Clearly structured difficulty levels ensure learners gradually acquire and confidently build foundational skills before tackling advanced culinary challenges.<br />
                    Real-Life Practicality: By using AR in their actual kitchens, students immediately translate digital instructions into real-world cooking skills.</p>
              
                    <h4><strong>Pros:</strong></h4>
                    <ul>
                     <li> ✔ Highly engaging and interactive: The game aspect is a fun way to motivate students to learn how to cook and would definitely keep them engaged in the learning activity. </li>
                     <li> ✔ Immersive Experience: The use of AR creates an immersive experience for the learner so that they can actually participate in the activity as if they were actually cooking.</li>
                    </ul>
              
                    <h4><strong>Cons:</strong></h4>
                    <ul>
                     <li> ✖ Doesn’t directly address problem: Although the game aspect is highly engaging and teaches the learners to cook under time constraints, because the learners would be creating a virtual dish, they aren’t actually learning how to cook.</li>
                     <li> ✖ Time consuming: Because this game is virtual and the students aren’t actually cooking a real meal, this solution could actually be more time consuming because the learner would have to set aside time to play this game which can take time away from actually cooking.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 style="text-align: center;">💡 Theory of Change & Design Rationale</h2>
                </header>
            
                <h3>The Need / Opportunity</h3>
                <p>This app is designed to help students build confidence and competence in cooking through a personalized, mobile experience based on their real-life constraints, such as limited time, tight budgets, and varying levels of cooking experience.</p>
            
                <h4>After completing the learning experience, students will:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Be able to cook simple meals suited to their dietary needs and budget (short-term).</li>
                    <li>Develop consistent cooking habits and better decision-making around food (mid-term).</li>
                    <li>Become nutritionally independent and maintain long-term healthy eating practices (long-term).</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h3>How the App Works: Activities & Features</h3>
            
                <h4>1. Self-Assessment & Goal Setting</h4>
                <p><strong>Feature:</strong> Upon onboarding, users complete a quick self-assessment to identify their current skill level, dietary preferences, and cooking goals.</p>
                <p><strong>Why This Supports Outcomes:</strong> This supports us to identify users' needs and helps them to choose the content, increasing relevance and motivation.</p>
                <p><strong>Design Rationale:</strong> Constructivism, which emphasizes the importance of starting from learners’ existing knowledge and goals (Bruner, 1960).</p>
            
                <h4>2. AI-Powered Personalized Learning Paths</h4>
                <p><strong>Feature:</strong> AI uses user data (preferences, interactions, time constraints) to recommend a progression of short cooking tutorials and challenges.</p>
                <p><strong>Why This Supports Outcomes:</strong> Keeps students engaged with manageable goals and promotes continued learning.</p>
                <p><strong>Design Rationale:</strong> Aligns with Vygotsky’s Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)—the app adjusts difficulty so students are always learning just above their current level.</p>
            
                <h4>3. Short Video Tutorials</h4>
                <p><strong>Feature:</strong> Bite-sized videos that mimic popular formats on TikTok or YouTube, demonstrating recipes and techniques.</p>
                <p><strong>Why This Supports Outcomes:</strong> Increases accessibility and motivation while modeling key behaviors.</p>
                <p><strong>Design Rationale:</strong> Based on Dual Coding Theory (Paivio, 1986)—combining visual + verbal input helps with memory and understanding.</p>
                <p><strong>Evidence:</strong> Mayer’s principles of multimedia learning support using short, focused visuals for better retention (Mayer, 2009).</p>
            
                <h4>4. Interactive Meal Planning Tools</h4>
                <p><strong>Feature:</strong> Students input available ingredients, dietary needs, and time/budget constraints to receive personalized recipe suggestions.</p>
                <p><strong>Why This Supports Outcomes:</strong> Promotes decision-making and real-world application of learned skills.</p>
                <p><strong>Design Rationale:</strong> Situated learning theory, which argues that learning is most effective when built into everyday tasks.</p>
            
                <h4>5. Progress Tracking & Informal Challenges</h4>
                <p><strong>Feature:</strong> The app tracks activity (e.g., completed recipes, streaks) and encourages students with low-stakes cooking challenges.</p>
                <p><strong>Why This Supports Outcomes:</strong> Builds confidence, encourages practice, and gives students a sense of achievement.</p>
                <p><strong>Design Rationale:</strong> Tied to experiential learning (Kolb, 1984)—students learn best through doing, reflecting, and iterating.</p>
            
                <h3>Areas of Uncertainty / Future Exploration</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>AI Accuracy:</strong> We assume AI will recommend appropriate tutorials. We need to validate these recommendations through user testing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Engagement Over Time:</strong> We’ll need to assess whether students stay engaged with the app long enough to develop lasting habits.</li>
                </ul>

        <h4>🔍 Informal Evaluation</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Usage Data Tracking:</strong> The app monitors engagement metrics like module completion rates, time spent on activities, frequency of logins, and how consistently learners interact with different features. These analytics help identify patterns in user behavior and potential barriers to engagement.</li>
          <li><strong>AI-Generated Feedback:</strong> After each cooking module or recipe tutorial, the AI assistant provides tailored suggestions—e.g., “Try a smaller dice on the carrots next time,” or “Well done following the timing steps!” This immediate, relevant feedback helps reinforce good habits while correcting mistakes in a non-judgmental manner.</li>
          <li><strong>Weekly Progress Dashboards:</strong> Learners receive a personalized summary showing their progress across different skill domains, including recipe completion, challenge participation, and goal alignment. This visual reinforcement helps build motivation and shows clear milestones achieved.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>🧠 Self-Assessment</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Reflective Prompts:</strong> After completing key activities, learners respond to prompts like “What did you find challenging about this task?” or “How would you improve your result next time?” This encourages metacognition and a growth mindset.</li>
          <li><strong>Confidence and Skill Rating:</strong> Learners rate themselves using a 5-point scale (e.g., 1 = not confident, 5 = very confident) across categories such as “chopping,” “meal planning,” and “budget cooking.” This data informs future learning paths and helps learners see personal development over time.</li>
          <li><strong>Visual Dashboard:</strong> Progress and reflection data are displayed on a personal dashboard, giving learners a quick overview of their growth and helping them set new goals. Optional notifications may prompt learners to revisit skills that haven’t been practiced recently.</li>

          After the last presentation, I re-examined and modified parts of my previous task analysis. Visualizing each phase and mapping activities onto the timeline helped clarify what this stage should truly focus on—breaking down the learner’s tasks and aligning them with outcomes, instead of jumping directly to activities or assessments. This process provided me with a clearer direction for the next steps.

          Working with George on the website layout made me realize how important collaboration is between different roles. I had to balance detailed content with how it would visually flow on the screen. This helped me prioritize clarity, consistency, and modularity—which are important.

          Creating the implementation plan pushed me beyond simply listing steps—it required me to critically analyze the logic and learner flow behind each phase. I realized that what sounds good on paper doesn’t always translate into actionable, learner-centered experiences. For example, I initially underestimated how difficult it is to balance learner autonomy with structured guidance. Planning this out forced me to think more deeply about sequencing: why a task must come first, what cognitive or motivational state it builds, and how it scaffolds the next step.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also grappled with feasibility—imagining technical limitations, time constraints, and learner bandwidth, which are often overlooked in idealized designs. Through this process, I developed a stronger understanding of instructional practicality and how to design with both user behavior and system limitations in mind.

          I really enjoyed this phase, as it gave us the opportunity to start ideating potential directions for our learning experience. The activities we worked on over the past few weeks, especially exploring different types of learning activities, assessments, and media tools, really pushed me to think more deeply and intentionally about each idea, rather than jumping to conclusions too quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Creating logic models was especially helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of our ideas and identifying ways to improve them. Overall, it was exciting to see the range of ideas my group and I came up with, and interesting to notice how aligned we were in the end. It made it easy for us to come to a shared decision on what we felt was the strongest solution to address our learning problem.

          I realized the importance of putting learning theories into practice. For example, by applying DCT for the short video activity, it helps to give our design a more clarified path, and makes us think deeper from the user's side. It connected our ideas to learning theories that felt more rational and solid.
        </p>
        <p>
          I liked making logic models the most, especially because of the activity we did in class. It gave me a clear structure of what I am doing and what should be done as the next step. For the next phase, I think it will be helpful to set small deadlines for specific tasks so we can move forward faster.
